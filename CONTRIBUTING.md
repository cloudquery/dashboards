## Adding a dashboard

- **Export**: First click export on the dashboard and remember to **click export for sharing externally**.
- **Folder**: Put in under the right folder in `dashboards` depending on the cloud provider with name `dashboard_name.json`.
- **Image**: Screenshot will be super helpful so put it with the same name but the `jpeg` suffix. Also, remember to remove any sensitive data from the screenshot.
- **Views**: If there are any other requirements such as special views that are needed put them under `views` and put a note in the main [README.md](./README.md)
